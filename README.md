•	Harry Potter Website

I've already published this website online. You can find it at https://harry-potter-web-site-production-bc6d.up.railway.app. This project used Java, Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL. Let me explain:
The main page contains a menu, which serves as the site's navigation. There's also a main image. I really like the look of the main screen; the image of Hogwarts really adds a touch of magic.

The main page also contains text about Harry Potter and some images related to him.

This page involves quite a bit of HTML and CSS work, as it's very detailed and contains many additional features.
Then comes the blog page, which uses MySQL because we store all the articles and posts from this blog in a database located in my Railway account. The posts are presented as sheets of parchment to match the site's style.

We can also view, delete and edit all articles on the site by clicking on the Details button.

Accordingly, any user can add a new article dedicated to the world of Harry Potter using the “Add a new article” button in the menu.

This website also has a faculty placement test, and I used JavaScript to determine the results.

The final component of this website is a short memory game. In this game, you have to find a pair for each card. It's implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

When you win, the game disappears and an animation appears on the screen along with a message stating that your faculty has won 10 points.
